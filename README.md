## Flexible Trash

Plugin for [fman.io](https://fman.io) that will trash files and directories using Finder if it is avaliable, or simple use the command line **rm** if it isn't. This is needed because I often close out Finder since I'm using alternative file managers.

You can install this plugin by pressing `<shift+cmd+p>` to open the command pallet. Then type `install plugin`. Look for the `Flexible Trash` plugin and select it.


### Usage

This plugin over rides the delete function to delete files and directories. It is transparent to normal operation.

### Features

- The ability to delete files/directories even if Finder isn't running.
